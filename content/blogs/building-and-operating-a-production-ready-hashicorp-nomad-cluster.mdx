# Building and Operating a Production-Ready HashiCorp Nomad Cluster

---

### üß† Overview

HashiCorp Nomad often flies under the radar compared to Kubernetes, but for many workloads, it‚Äôs the perfect orchestration tool ‚Äî lightweight, fast, and flexible.  
If you‚Äôve ever felt that Kubernetes was overkill for your use case, or that you needed something simpler to operate yet still powerful enough for production, **Nomad** deserves your attention.

In this guide, we‚Äôll dive into how to **design, deploy, and operate a Nomad cluster** for real-world use. We‚Äôll go from architecture fundamentals to practical setup and operational best practices, all grounded in lessons from managing Nomad in production environments.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Core Concepts

Before jumping into configuration, let‚Äôs get clear on the core building blocks that make Nomad clusters so effective.

#### 1. Nomad Architecture: Servers and Clients

At its core, a Nomad cluster is made up of **two types of agents**:
- **Server nodes:** Handle scheduling, leader election, and cluster state.  
- **Client nodes:** Execute jobs (containers, binaries, or VMs).

Each Nomad agent runs the same binary ‚Äî you configure it to behave as either a **server** or a **client**.  
This simplicity is one of Nomad‚Äôs greatest strengths.

**Example cluster layout:**
```

+------------------------+
|        Nomad UI        |
+------------------------+
|
+------------------+
|  Nomad Servers   |   <-- Raft-based quorum (3 or 5 nodes recommended)
+------------------+
|
+------------------+
|  Nomad Clients   |   <-- Run workloads (Docker, exec, qemu, etc.)
+------------------+

````

The **servers** maintain the Raft consensus state, meaning they require an odd number for quorum (usually 3 or 5).  
The **clients** are scalable and can exist across data centers or regions ‚Äî a perfect fit for hybrid or multi-cloud setups.

#### 2. Regions and Datacenters

Nomad supports multi-region architecture natively.  
A **region** is a set of **datacenters**, and each datacenter represents a distinct logical or physical location.  
This allows you to scale workloads globally while keeping scheduling local to each region.

#### 3. Jobs, Tasks, and Drivers

Jobs in Nomad are defined using **HCL** (HashiCorp Configuration Language).  
A job can contain multiple **task groups**, each running one or more **tasks** using different **drivers**.

Example drivers include:
- `docker` (most common for container workloads)
- `exec` (for raw binary execution)
- `qemu` (for VMs)
- `raw_exec` (for bare metal tasks)

Example job:
```hcl
job "web" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]

  group "frontend" {
    count = 2

    task "nginx" {
      driver = "docker"

      config {
        image = "nginx:alpine"
        ports = ["http"]
      }

      resources {
        cpu    = 500
        memory = 256
      }
    }

    network {
      port "http" {
        static = 8080
      }
    }
  }
}
````

#### 4. Service Discovery and Secrets

Nomad integrates tightly with **Consul** for service discovery and **Vault** for secrets management.
Together, these create a seamless ecosystem for dynamic service registration and secure credential delivery.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Guide

Let‚Äôs walk through how to set up a simple yet production-grade Nomad cluster.

#### Step 1: Install Nomad on Each Node

On each server and client:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y unzip
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/nomad/1.8.0/nomad_1.8.0_linux_amd64.zip
unzip nomad_1.8.0_linux_amd64.zip
sudo mv nomad /usr/local/bin/
nomad version
```

#### Step 2: Configure Nomad Server Agents

Each server node requires a configuration file ‚Äî for example, `/etc/nomad.d/server.hcl`:

```hcl
data_dir  = "/opt/nomad"
bind_addr = "0.0.0.0"

server {
  enabled          = true
  bootstrap_expect = 3
}

advertise {
  http = "10.0.1.10"
  rpc  = "10.0.1.10"
  serf = "10.0.1.10"
}
```

Then start the agent:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable nomad
sudo systemctl start nomad
```

Repeat this for all three servers.

#### Step 3: Configure Nomad Client Agents

Client nodes need a slightly different configuration (`/etc/nomad.d/client.hcl`):

```hcl
data_dir  = "/opt/nomad"
bind_addr = "0.0.0.0"

client {
  enabled = true
  servers = ["10.0.1.10:4647", "10.0.1.11:4647", "10.0.1.12:4647"]
}

plugin "docker" {
  config {
    volumes {
      enabled = true
    }
  }
}
```

Once the clients are up, they‚Äôll automatically register with the Nomad servers.

#### Step 4: Verify the Cluster

Check cluster membership:

```bash
nomad server members
nomad node status
```

You should see all servers and clients listed.
You can also access the Nomad UI (default: `http://<server-ip>:4646/ui`) to visualize the cluster.

#### Step 5: Submit a Job

Use the earlier HCL example or submit your own:

```bash
nomad job run web.nomad
```

Nomad will schedule and run the tasks across available client nodes.
You can monitor progress directly from the CLI or UI:

```bash
nomad job status web
```

### üß© Automation and Best Practices

Once your cluster is running, treat it like any other production system ‚Äî automate, observe, and secure it.

#### 1. Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

Use **Terraform** to provision Nomad infrastructure (servers, clients, networking, IAM).
HashiCorp‚Äôs Nomad provider allows you to define jobs, ACLs, and namespaces as code.

Example Terraform snippet:

```hcl
resource "nomad_job" "web" {
  jobspec = file("${path.module}/jobs/web.nomad")
}
```

This ensures consistency between environments and makes deployments reproducible.

#### 2. Security and Access Control

Enable **ACLs** in Nomad to restrict API and UI access:

```hcl
acl {
  enabled = true
}
```

Then bootstrap the ACL system:

```bash
nomad acl bootstrap
```

Always store tokens securely (Vault, not local files), and encrypt gossip and RPC traffic using TLS certificates.

#### 3. Monitoring and Observability

Integrate Nomad with Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog.
Nomad exposes metrics via HTTP, making it easy to scrape cluster health and resource usage.
For logs, forward agent logs to a centralized system such as Loki or ELK.

#### 4. Rolling Upgrades

To upgrade Nomad safely:

1. Upgrade one server at a time.
2. Wait for the cluster to regain quorum before proceeding.
3. Upgrade clients progressively ‚Äî jobs will automatically reschedule.

Nomad supports version skew between servers and clients, which makes this process low-risk.

#### 5. Scaling the Cluster

Add new clients dynamically as workload grows.
You can even automate autoscaling with **Nomad Autoscaler** and cloud APIs.

Example policy:

```hcl
scaling "web" {
  enabled = true

  policy {
    cooldown = "2m"
    check "cpu" {
      source = "prometheus"
      query  = "avg(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[5m]))"
      strategy = "threshold"
      target   = 0.75
    }
  }
}
```

This helps maintain performance without manual intervention.
